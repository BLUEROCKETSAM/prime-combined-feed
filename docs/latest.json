    "description": "On July 9, 2025, Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe signed Senate Bill 68 into \r\nlaw, enacting a statewide ban on electronic communication devices in \r\nMissouri public and charter schools beginning with the 2025–26 academic \r\nyear. This bill comes in response to growing concerns among Missourians \r\nabout technology in the classroom and reflects a broader desire to promote \r\neducational attainment, safety, and effective working environments for \r\nemployees in Missouri schools.",
