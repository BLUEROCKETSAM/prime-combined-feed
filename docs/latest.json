    "description": "In Missouri, student homelessness is not just a growing crisis—it’s an \r\nurgent education policy issue. According to our new report, more than \r\n34,000 students in Missouri’s public schools were identified as \r\nexperiencing homelessness during the 2022–23 academic year. That’s 1 in \r\nevery 25 students, far higher than the national average. While Missouri \r\nmakes up just 1.8% of the U.S. population, it accounts for 2.5% of all \r\nstudents identified as homeless nationwide—an overrepresentation that \r\ndemands serious attention.",

    "description": "The US Department of Education released a report yesterday by, among others \r\nat the Regional Education Laboratory (REL) Central, PRiME’s own Kathryn \r\nColeman, Collin Hitt, and Saint Louis University School of Education Dean, \r\nGary Ritter. \r\n\r\nThe report examined features of early-career teacher mentoring for the \r\npurposes of understanding its effects on teacher retention within schools. \r\nThe study was requested by the Missouri Department of Elementary and \r\nSecondary Education (MO DESE) toward the goal of improving teacher \r\nretention in Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe study found that more than half of first-year teachers met with their \r\nmentors multiple times per month, but the amount of time and specific \r\nactivities of the meetings varied widely.\r\n\r\nTo read more, find the full report here.",

    "description": "When it comes to student achievement in Missouri, the story depends on \r\nwhich test you’re reading. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Missouri \r\nstudents—like students across the country—have faced significant academic \r\nchallenges. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), often \r\nreferred to as the \"Nation’s Report Card,\" tells us that reading and math \r\nscores in Missouri have dropped dramatically for both 4th and 8th graders. \r\nBut a look at the state’s own MAP (Missouri Assessment Program) test \r\nresults paints a different picture: only slight declines, and in some \r\ncases, no decline at all.",

    "description": "Each year, Missouri gives standardized tests to all public school kids \r\ngrades 3 through 8 to gauge their proficiency in math and English. In the \r\n2023–2024 school year, only a tenth of KIPP Wonder’s kids who took the \r\ntests scored “proficient” in English. That’s 31 points below the state \r\naverage. But it’s just a snapshot—and, in large part, due to factors \r\noutside any school’s control, such as community and family resources. \r\nMissouri also calculates a growth metric, one that Collin Hitt, the \r\nexecutive director of Saint Louis University’s education policy group, \r\nPRiME Center, calls “the best in the country.” It asks the question: How \r\nfar did students move forward in a subject, regardless of where they \r\nstarted, and in comparison to other similarly situated students? And on \r\nthat metric, KIPP Wonder showed the second largest average leap in English \r\nof all public elementary schools in Missouri, according to a PRiME analysis\r\n. (They were second only to a school in the Ozarks.)",
