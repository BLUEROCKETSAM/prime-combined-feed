    "description": "Last year, we published a report titled Empty Desks: An Analysis of Chronic \r\nAbsenteeism in Missouri Schools, detailing the growing attendance problem \r\nstate- and nationwide. In the 2023-24 school year, more than 1 in 5 \r\nstudents was chronically absent, missing more than 10% of scheduled school \r\ndays in a school year. The recent release of the 2024-25 data suggests a \r\nshifting trend.",
